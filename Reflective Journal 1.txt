Reflective Journal 1Out of the six themes we had the choice of basing our coursework on, our group felt as if that the one that appealed to us the most was the one called strong encryptions, Cypherpunks and society.  At first glance we noticed that this theme was less vague than some of the others such as ‘The Free and Open Internet’ and as such we would have something more specific to look into and research. Furthermore, the theme we had chosen could link into some of the other themes such as ‘A Brief History of Hactivism’.  After doing a bit of research into my theme, I found out a few interesting things that my group would benefit from. Starting with ‘A Cypherpunks’ Manifesto’ Written by Eric Hughes. I found out that the name ‘Cypherpunks’ was a term he created in order to describe the ideas of cyberpunks merged together with encryptions (Hughes, 1993). This in itself was a nice surprise as a couple people in my group had the theme of cyberpunks as a previous coursework topic.  Another thing I discovered through my research was about some of the strong encryptions that ‘Cypherpunks’ would use. ‘PGP’ or ‘Pretty Good Privacy’ is a hybrid cryptosystem where the user would compress the plaintext and then create a session key, which becomes like a random number generator making it really secure to keep out even government authorities (PGPI, 1999). References:1.
