Reflective Journal 3Through the use of agile project methods, my group and me have been able to work quickly and efficiently in order to compliment each other’s specific tasks and complete our overall goal. Using software such as taiga.io and git hub, it has allowed us to simplify the task and keep track of what everyone was doing so we were able to finish on time. On taiga.io, the scrum and especially the kanban, choosing tasks for different members of the group and monitoring the progress was child’s play. It was a simple and easy reminder of what was left to do. Plus with the option to block certain tasks and reallocate tasks to different members, there is no confusion.  Github allowed us as a group to create a repository using the command line and as such put all our work together. This is a great way to store and view what everyone in the group has done and as such give critical feedback. Despite it being difficult to get to grips with in the beginning, it has become a very useful and vital tool for group work that has made life a lot easier.  For easy tracking and efficient working, agile project methods are the way to go.
