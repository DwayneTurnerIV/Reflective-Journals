Reflective Journal 2Listening to ‘The Force of Google’ podcast, I found very interesting and thought-provoking ideas that were brought up that made me question how important Google actually is to us in the modern era. Right from the beginning, you hear various people discussing how the Google search algorithm is one that the majority of people depends on and is as such considered to being one of the most powerful out there in the world. As the podcast continues it goes on to say that since Google’s short existence, its usage has become a dominant feature not just on the Internet but in both speech and writing as well. I also found out that their algorithm is very complex as it is constantly changing in order to allow people to find exactly what they are looking for. They add about 1000 changes a year and test around 10000. Despite all this, some people still claim that there are issues with it.  Due to claims that Google is ‘biased’ many believe that business struggle to make a name for themselves on the search engine. Another so-called problem is the ill effective ‘right to be forgotten’ on the Internet. When people are searched on the Internet, on some occasions, the first few things to come up, doesn’t show an accurate representation of them. Arguably the most far-fetched issue that was brought up was that the power of Google could possibly affect politics and sway election results due to how positive of negative they show each candidate. In my opinion Google is definitely a revelation that had contributed massively to shape the world as it is today and it will continue for some time.
